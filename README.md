## Automatic classification of fold geometries from outcrop images using deep learning


## Abstract
Machine learning is being presented as a new solution for a wide range of geoscience problems. Primarily machine learning has been used for 3D seismic data interpretation, processing, seismic facies analysis and well-log data correlation. The rapid development in technology with open-source artificial intelligence libraries and the accessibility of affordable computer graphics processing units (GPU) makes the application of machine learning in geosciences increasingly tractable. However, the application of artificial intelligence in structural interpretation workflows of subsurface datasets is still ambiguous. This study aims to use machine learning techniques to classify images of folds and fold-thrust structures. Here we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as supervised deep learning techniques provide excellent algorithms to discriminate between geological image datasets. Outcrop images and modelled datasets have been used to train and test ML models. This dataset comprises three classes (Box, Chevron and Rounded) of folds types. These image datasets are used to investigate a wide range of shallow, deep and transfer machine learning models. One traditional machine learning and five convolutional neural network models (Convolution 2D layer with Residual block model (ResNet with 9, 34, 50, 101 and 152 layers)). Validation and testing datasets form a critical part of testing the modelâ€™s performance accuracy. The ResNet-50 model records the highest performance accuracy score of the machine learning models tested. Our CNN image classification model analysis provides a framework for applying machine learning to increase structural interpretation efficiency and shows that CNN classification models can be applied effectively to geoscience problems. The study provides a starting point to apply deep learning approaches to sub-surface structural interpretation workflows.

## Introduction
Folds are wavelike structures that occur during permanent deformation (Ramsay and Huber 1987). They are formed when beds and layers are transformed into curved, bent, and crumpled shapes (Ramsay and Huber 1987). They are perhaps the most common tectonic structure developed in deformed rocks. Folds are an expression of ductile deformation which produces gradual and more continuous changes in a rock layer, both in attitude and internally (Ramsay and Huber 1987). The folds as structures are categorised as Box, Chevron and Rounded based on their geometrical hinge shape (the point with maximum curvature). The geometric analysis of folds forms the basis for the kinematic and dynamic analyses. In geometrical analysis, the structures and their homogeneity with respect to different domains were investigated. Geometric analysis is essential not only in order to understand how various types of folds form but also to provide a platform to understand the regional structure, quantify deformation and consequently explore tectonic processes.
